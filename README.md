# Fabric Identification using AI-based Analysis and Optimization of Raman Spectroscopic Data

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project on fabric identification using AI-based analysis and optimization of Raman spectroscopic data. The research, conducted by Mitarth Arora (B20EE096) under the supervision of Prof. Ajay Agarwal at the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, aims to address challenges in efficient fabric recycling through the development of an innovative fabric identification system.

## Project Highlights
- **Dataset:** A comprehensive dataset comprising major fabrics (Cotton, Lycra, Nylon, Viscose, Polyester) with 2527 samples.
- **Optimization:** Meticulous exploration of Integration Time (IT) and Laser Power (LP) to identify the sweet spot for accurate fabric identification.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Implementation of neural networks for automated fabric recognition, leveraging insights from Raman spectroscopy.
